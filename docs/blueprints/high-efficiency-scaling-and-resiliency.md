# Technical Blueprint: High-Efficiency Scaling & Resiliency Architecture

This blueprint documents the architectural patterns enabling Credence to scale horizontally to 100M+ monthly queries while maintaining strict cost bounds and $G=1.00$ verbatim epistemic grounding.

## 1. The 5 Value Pillars

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    P1["1. Immutable Edge Caching<br/>(95%+ read offload via Cloudflare CDN)"]
    P2["2. Dual-Dialect SQL<br/>(SQLite WAL and Managed PostgreSQL)"]
    P3["3. Fast-Path Ingestion<br/>(50ms Trafilatura with deferred Playwright)"]
    P4["4. Shared State Store<br/>(Atomic Lua token metering & feed locks)"]
    P5["5. CAS Blob Storage<br/>(Cloudflare R2 zero-egress snapshots)"]

    P1 & P2 & P3 & P4 & P5 --> Scale["Planetary Epistemic Network<br/>(Sub-20ms global read latency, <$40/mo cloud cost)"]
```

## 2. Ingestion Decision Matrix

Trafilatura handles 95% of standard news articles in $<50\text{ms}$ consuming $<15\text{MB}$ RAM. Full Playwright Chromium capture is only invoked when:
1. Extracted text is $<50$ words (indicating client-side SPA rendering).
2. Deceptive pattern inspection (`DP-*`) is explicitly requested under `profile=ultra`.
