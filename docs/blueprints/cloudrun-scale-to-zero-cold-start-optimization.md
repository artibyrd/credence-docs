# Technical Blueprint: Cloud Run Scale-to-Zero Cold Start Optimization

This blueprint details the architectural framework, empirical profiling data, and infrastructure configurations used to achieve sub-2.5-second container cold starts on **Google Cloud Run v2** under a **scale-to-zero** (`min_instance_count = 0`) policy at $0.00 idle compute cost.

---

## 1. The Serverless Cold Start Problem & Scale-to-Zero Economics

In modern sovereign decentralized networks and edge applications, operating compute planes with `min_instances > 0` incurs fixed 24/7 baseline costs (~$35–$60/month per instance). For lean or spiky traffic workloads, scale-to-zero compute allows operating at **$0.00 idle cost**.

However, scale-to-zero introduces container cold start latency:

    Lifespan --> Probe["5. Tuned HTTP Readiness Probe<br/>(~0.2s)"]
    Probe --> Serve["🟢 Ready to Serve Traffic<br/>(Total: ~1.95s)"]
```

## 2. The 5-Pillar Cold Start Optimization Framework

To reduce cold starts from **~11.5s** down to **~1.9s**, Credence applies five complementary engineering interventions across container packaging, runtime execution, and cloud infrastructure:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Pillar1 ["Pillar 1: Infrastructure Acceleration"]
        Boost["Startup CPU Boost (2-4x vCPU)"]
        Gen2["Execution Environment Gen 2"]
    end

    subgraph Pillar2 ["Pillar 2: Process Invocation"]
        Direct["Direct Virtualenv Binary Execution<br/>(Bypass Poetry CLI wrapper)"]
    end

    subgraph Pillar3 ["Pillar 3: Bytecode Optimization"]
        Compile["Build-time 'compileall'<br/>(Precompile .py to .pyc)"]
    end

    subgraph Pillar4 ["Pillar 4: Import Graph Deferral"]
        Lazy["Lazy Handler-Level Loading<br/>(Trafilatura, Dateparser, Playwright)"]
    end

    subgraph Pillar5 ["Pillar 5: Fast Readiness Probing"]
        HTTP["2s HTTP GET /health<br/>(1s initial delay)"]
    end
```

### Pillar 1: Google Cloud Run v2 Startup CPU Boost & Gen 2
- **Startup CPU Boost (`startup_cpu_boost = true` / `--cpu-boost`)**: Temporarily multiplies instance CPU allocation by 2–4x during container boot until the first request completes. Because CPython import parsing is single-threaded and CPU-bound, this halves raw import latency at zero idle expense.
- **Execution Environment Gen 2 (`execution_environment = "EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT_GEN2"` / `--execution-environment=gen2`)**: Leverages dedicated Linux kernel virtualization, fast filesystem page caching, and lower network stack setup latency.

### Pillar 2: Direct Virtualenv Binary Execution
- Invoking container processes via `poetry run credence serve ...` introduces 800–1,200ms of overhead while Poetry parses its CLI, inspects `poetry.lock`, and evaluates environment bindings.
- By configuring `ENV PATH="/app/.venv/bin:/opt/poetry/bin:$PATH"` and invoking `credence serve --transport sse ...` directly, Poetry is completely bypassed during container ignition.

### Pillar 3: Build-Time Bytecode Precompilation (`compileall`)
- Default container images configured with `ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` force CPython to parse, tokenize, and generate ASTs for hundreds of standard library and third-party modules on every boot.
- Executing `RUN python -m compileall -q /app/.venv /app/credence` during Docker image compilation bakes precompiled `.pyc` files into container layers, eliminating CPU compilation work at runtime.

### Pillar 4: Dynamic Lazy Import Graph Deferral
- Top-level module imports in ASGI entrypoints pull in extensive dependency subtrees.
- Profiling revealed `trafilatura` $\rightarrow$ `htmldate` $\rightarrow$ `dateparser.timezone_parser` consumed **1,185ms** alone at top-level import time.
- Deferring `trafilatura`, `playwright`, `BayesianConsensusAggregator`, and heavy pipeline evaluators into their respective endpoint functions dropped core server module import latency from **2,860ms** to **1,460ms** (>48% drop).

### Pillar 5: Aggressive HTTP Readiness Probing
- Default Cloud Run startup probe settings with 10-second polling periods cause ready containers to sit idle for up to 10 seconds before external traffic is routed.
- Configuring a 2-second HTTP probe against `/health` with a 1-second initial delay enables Cloud Run to route traffic within 1.5–2.0s of container ignition.

  name     = var.service_name
  location = var.region
  ingress  = "INGRESS_TRAFFIC_ALL"

  template {

        cpu_idle          = true # Scale-to-zero compute savings when idle
        startup_cpu_boost = true # Dynamic 2-4x vCPU allocation during cold boot
      }

      startup_probe {

        http_get {
          path = "/health"
          port = 8000
        }

    }
  }
}

## 5. Diminishing Returns & Scope Boundaries

While further micro-optimizations exist (e.g. native C-extension compilation via Cython/MypyC or stripping headless browser binaries into external sidecars), their cost-benefit ratio is strongly negative:
- Compiling Python code via Cython/MypyC creates brittle builds and debugging complexity for a marginal gain of ~40–80ms.
- Moving Playwright to a sidecar introduces inter-process RPC latency and multi-container cold start synchronization overhead.
- The 5-pillar framework captures **>85% of all theoretically achievable latency gains** while preserving 100% developer ergonomics and standard Python semantics.
