# The Economics of Decentralized Truth

Evaluating internet content at scale using frontier AI models presents an economic dilemma: standalone evaluation of high-volume feeds burns thousands of dollars in redundant token costs.

This document models the economics of **BitTorrent-style attestation work-sharing** in the Credence network.

## 1. Standalone vs Cooperative Compute Cost Model

Let:
- $N$ = number of participating nodes (e.g. 13 nodes).
- $A$ = total distinct articles published daily across target feeds (e.g. 500 articles/day).
- $C_{\text{eval}}$ = average cost to perform an epistemic audit with Gemini 3.7 Flash ($\approx \$0.012$ / article).

### Standalone Evaluation (No Mesh):
Every node independently audits every article:

$$\text{Cost}_{\text{standalone}} = N \times A \times C_{\text{eval}}$$

For $N = 13$ and $A = 500$:
$$\text{Cost}_{\text{standalone}} = 13 \times 500 \times \$0.012 = \$78.00/\text{day} \quad (\$2,340/\text{month})$$

### Cooperative Mesh Work-Sharing:
Articles are partitioned across the $N$ nodes. Each node audits only $\frac{A}{N}$ articles, signs the results with Ed25519, and seeds the attestation to the remaining $N - 1$ peers:

$$\text{Cost}_{\text{mesh}} = A \times C_{\text{eval}} = 500 \times \$0.012 = \$6.00/\text{day} \quad (\$180/\text{month})$$

$$\text{Cost per Node} = \frac{\$6.00}{13} = \$0.46/\text{day} \quad (\$13.85/\text{month})$$

$$\text{Aggregate Compute Savings} = 1 - \frac{1}{N} = 1 - \frac{1}{13} = 92.307\%$$

## 2. Token Headroom & Safety Governor (Invariant 7)

To ensure zero unexpected cost overruns:
- **Headroom Margin**: The governor reserves a 30% token headroom before the billing cycle ceiling.
- **Offline Circuit Breaker**: If spend exceeds the threshold, the node trips `QUOTA_PRESERVED` mode, seamlessly switching to offline structural heuristics ($S \le 50.0$, confidence $\le 0.50$) without interrupting agent workflows.
