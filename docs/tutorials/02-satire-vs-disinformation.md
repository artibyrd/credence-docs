# Tutorial 02: Poe's Law & Satire Cloaking

Explore how **Credence** handles the nuance between legitimate satire (like *The Onion*) and deceptive "satire-cloaked" disinformation that advances harmful medical or civic falsehoods.

---

## The Challenge: Poe's Law in Automated Systems

**Poe's Law** observes that without clear intent indicators, it is impossible to author an exaggeration so absurd that someone will not mistake it for a sincere statement. 

Adversaries exploit this by publishing dangerous falsehoods (e.g. fabricated election fraud or lethal health claims) behind tiny "satire" disclaimers in the footer to evade legal and platform accountability.

## 1. Legitimate Satire Detection

When Credence encounters legitimate satire (e.g., an article from *The Onion* or a site with explicit `SatiricalArticle` Schema.org markup):

```bash
credence audit https://theonion.com/example-satire-story
```

### The Result:
- **Structural Cue Recognized**: Credence extracts masthead cues and Schema.org metadata.
- **Score Neutralization**: Suspicion score is neutralized to **`0.00 / 100`** with `is_satire: true`.
- Honest parody is protected from automated penalties.

## 2. Satire Cloaking Override (`SPJ-1.6`)

When an article claims to be "satire" but contains **unfounded factual allegations regarding public health, financial fraud, or election results**:

```bash
credence audit https://deceptive-site.test/fake-vaccine-claim
```

### The Invariant in Action (Invariant 13 & 28):
- The `SPJ-1.6` (Cloaked Disinformation) specialist rule triggers.
- Satire immunity is **immediately stripped**.
- The suspicion score is penalized to **`90.0+ / 100`**, and the finding is flagged:
  ```text
  [SPJ-1.6] Satire Cloaking Hard-Override Triggered
  Finding: Unsubstantiated lethal medical allegation cannot be cloaked as satire.
  Satire Protection: DISABLED
  ```
