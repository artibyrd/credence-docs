# Tutorial 01: Auditing Anonymous Clickbait

Learn how to use the **Credence CLI** to audit an unverified, sensationalized web article, inspect its DOM extraction, verify grounded quote offsets ($G = 1.0$), and calculate suspicion scores.

---

## What You'll Learn
- How Credence captures web snapshots via Playwright headless Chromium.
- How the Multi-Agent Pipeline checks claims against the **SPJ Code of Ethics** catalog.
- How the Grounded Quote Validator eliminates hallucinations.
- How to inspect findings in the CLI and view the cryptographic JSON envelope.

## 1. Running Your First Audit

To evaluate an online URL:

```bash
credence audit https://example.com/breaking-news --profile BALANCED
```

### What Happens Behind the Scenes:
1. **DOM Ingestion**: Headless Chromium navigates to the page, strips tracking scripts and cookie banners, extracts clean prose text, and hashes the DOM.
2. **Specialist Evaluation**: 4 specialist agents analyze sourcing attribution, sensationalized headlines, and logical fallacies.
3. **Citation Verification**: Every reported violation is tested against the DOM text. If a quote cannot be found verbatim (accounting for collapsed whitespace sequences), it is discarded and the node's quality score is penalized.

## 2. Reading the Terminal Output

```text
============================================================
Credence Epistemic Audit Report
Target URL: https://example.com/breaking-news
Snapshot SHA-256: 7f83b1657ff1fc53b92dc18148a1d65dfc2d4b1fa3d677284addd200126d9069
Evaluated At: 2026-08-17T16:00:00Z
============================================================

Overall Suspicion Score: 84.5 / 100 [HIGH SUSPICION]
Violation Density: 4.2 violations / 1,000 words
Grounded Quote Verification: 100% (G = 1.0)

Detected Violations:
  [SPJ-1.1] Anonymous Sourcing Violation (Severity: 4)
    Quote: "Officials who spoke on condition of anonymity revealed secret plans..."
    Rationale: Major factual assertion lacks named attribution or corroborating documents.

  [FALLACY-3.2] Appeal to Fear / Sensationalism (Severity: 3)
    Quote: "Total disaster is imminent unless drastic measures are taken immediately."
    Rationale: Emotional hyperbolic language without supporting statistical evidence.
============================================================
```

## 3. Inspecting in the Textual TUI Workstation

You can also inspect clickbait and deceptive patterns interactively in the full-screen terminal workstation:

```bash
credence tui
```

Press `/`, submit the URL, and examine the dual-pane inspector:

![Credence TUI Workstation](../../assets/tui/01-inspector-rich.svg)

* **Left Panel**: Filter violations by severity or domain (e.g. `SPJ-1.1`, `MED-1.2`, `DP-1.1`).
* **Right Panel**: Full verbatim grounded quotes and specialist justifications.
* Press `v` to toggle between **Rich Takeaway**, **Compact Digest**, and **Raw RFC 8785 JSON** modes.

---

## 4. Exporting the Signed Attestation

To export the signed RFC 8785 canonical JSON envelope:

```bash
credence export --url https://example.com/breaking-news --output breaking-news.credence.json
```

Inspect the exported file to view the Ed25519 public key, timestamp, content hash, and signed payload.
