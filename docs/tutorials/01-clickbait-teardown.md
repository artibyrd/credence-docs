Learn how to use the **Credence CLI** to audit an unverified, sensationalized web article, inspect its DOM extraction, verify grounded quote offsets ($G = 1.0$), and calculate suspicion scores.

---

## What You'll Learn
- How Credence captures web snapshots via Playwright headless Chromium.
- How the Multi-Agent Pipeline checks claims against the **SPJ Code of Ethics** catalog.
- How the Grounded Quote Validator eliminates hallucinations.
- How to inspect findings in the CLI and view the cryptographic JSON envelope.

## 1. Running Your First Audit

To evaluate an online URL:

```bash
credence audit https://example.com/breaking-news --profile BALANCED
```

### What Happens Behind the Scenes:
1. **DOM Ingestion**: Headless Chromium navigates to the page, strips tracking scripts and cookie banners, extracts clean prose text, and hashes the DOM.
2. **Specialist Evaluation**: 4 specialist agents analyze sourcing attribution, sensationalized headlines, and logical fallacies.
3. **Citation Verification**: Every reported violation is tested against the DOM text. If a quote cannot be found verbatim (accounting for collapsed whitespace sequences), it is discarded and the node's quality score is penalized.

## 2. Reading the Terminal Output

## 3. Exporting the Signed Attestation

To export the signed RFC 8785 canonical JSON envelope:

```bash
credence export --url https://example.com/breaking-news --output breaking-news.credence.json
```

Inspect the exported file to view the Ed25519 public key, timestamp, content hash, and signed payload.
