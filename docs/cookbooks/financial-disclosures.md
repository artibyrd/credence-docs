Corporate press releases and quarterly SEC filings often contain evasive phrasing, non-GAAP exclusions, ungrounded forward projections, and disguised conflicts of interest.

This cookbook shows how to use **Credence with the ULTRA operational profile** to execute deep syllogistic reasoning audits on financial texts.

## 1. Why the ULTRA Profile Matters for Finance

While the `BALANCED` profile (1,024 thinking tokens) excels at everyday journalism and dark patterns, financial audits require **deep chain-of-thought reasoning**:
- Correlating footnote disclosures with top-line GAAP operating income.
- Detecting subtle non-sequiturs in CEO answers during earnings call Q&A sessions.
- Identifying cherry-picked time horizons in performance graphs.

The `ULTRA` profile allocates up to **16,384 thinking tokens** on Gemini 3.7 Flash to exhaustively trace logical entailments before outputting findings.
