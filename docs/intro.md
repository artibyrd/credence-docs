# Welcome to Credence 🛡️

**Credence** is an open-source trust engine, FastMCP 2.0 server, and decentralized verification network. It audits web articles, news stories, and research claims for **clickbait, logical fallacies, and deceptive tactics** — backing every finding with **100% exact quotes from the original text** so there are zero AI hallucinations.

Instead of subjective "truthiness" scores or centralized arbiters, Credence provides **transparent, verifiable receipts** that anyone can inspect.

> [!NOTE]
> 🎮 **Try It in Your Browser**: Experience Credence's algorithms live without installing anything! Test the **[12 Interactive Zero-Build Playgrounds](playground.md)** (13-node mesh simulator, SimHash matrix, Token Governor) and the **[InMaricopa Forensic Case Study Workbench](../blog/conflict-of-pun-terest.md)** with live clickable DOM evidence and policy reform simulation.

## 💡 The 4 Pillars of Grounded Truth

Credence is built around four fundamental design principles:

### 1. 🔍 Verbatim Evidence (Zero Hallucinations)
Every flagged violation requires an exact, word-for-word quote from the original source text. If an AI model flags a claim but cannot quote the exact sentence from the page, the finding is discarded.

### 2. 📜 Established Ethical & Logical Standards
Audits are evaluated against established, public taxonomy catalogs:
* **SPJ Journalistic Ethics**: Unnamed sources, unverified allegations, conflicts of interest.
* **IEP Logical Fallacies**: Ad Hominem, Straw Man, False Dilemma, Circular Reasoning.
* **Deceptive UI Patterns**: Fake countdown urgency, confirmshaming, hidden costs.

### 3. 🎭 Smart Satire Awareness (Poe's Law)
Legitimate humor and parody (*The Onion, The Babylon Bee*) are recognized and scored neutrally ($0.00$), preventing false alarms while signaling downstream AI agents not to treat hyperbole as literal fact. However, bad-faith disinformation attempting to cloak defamatory allegations as "humor" is strictly intercepted.

### 4. 🔏 Tamper-Proof Cryptographic Receipts
Every evaluation produces an Ed25519-signed `.credence.json` envelope. Anyone can verify that the score and quoted evidence haven't been altered by any intermediary or relay node.

## 🏛️ How Credence Works

Credence operates as a decoupled, 3-plane epistemic verification architecture:
1. **Edge Plane**: Zero-build static dashboards, WebCrypto verification widgets, and Cloudflare Pages previews.
2. **Compute Plane**: High-throughput FastAPI services, streaming FastMCP 2.0 servers, and multi-model LLM adapters.
3. **P2P Mesh Plane**: 13-node Watts-Strogatz gossip networks, Bloom filter attestation exchange, and Bayesian consensus aggregation.

## 🖥️ The 4 Universal Interfaces

Credence maintains 100% synchronous feature parity across 4 distinct interfaces:

* **🖥️ Command Line (CLI)**: Fast forensic audits, structured JSON pipes for shell scripting (`jq`, `xargs`), and CI/CD PR gates.
* **⚡ FastMCP 2.0**: Equip Claude Desktop, Cursor, and agent swarms with tools over `stdio` and streaming `HTTP/SSE`.
* **📟 Textual TUI (`credence tui`)**: Full-screen keyboard-driven workstation with live citation highlighting and taxonomy explorer.
* **🌐 Zero-Build Web UI (`web/`)**: High-contrast browser report viewer with zero npm dependencies and client-side Web Crypto verification.
