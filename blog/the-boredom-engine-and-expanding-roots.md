# The Boredom Engine & Expanding Roots: How Autonomous Nodes Self-Direct Epistemic Discovery

When our first sovereign production node was launched onto Cloud Run, it ran flawlessly. It listened to FastMCP 2.0 tool requests, answered queries over SSE, reported zero-latency health status, and stayed within nominal memory constraints (174 MB).

Yet something was wrong: **it was completely idle.**

It had 26 seed feed subscriptions and 35 discovered articles in SQLite. But after its initial burst, 27 pending feed items sat un-audited in the database queue, and 0 new source discoveries had occurred. The node possessed 100% token headroom, 0% CPU load, and virtually unlimited capacity—yet like a bored employee waiting for a manager's ticket, it did nothing.

In **Credence v1.16.0**, we introduced the **Boredom Engine** and **Autonomous Epistemic Root Expansion**.

## The Philosophy of Autonomous Curiosity

Conventional server architectures treat idle time as a passive state. Compute sits asleep until an external HTTP request or cron trigger arrives.

In a decentralized epistemic network, **idleness is wasted truth opportunity**.

Every second a verification node sits with unused LLM token quota:
1. Pending syndicated articles remain un-evaluated, leaving readers vulnerable to unverified claims.
2. High-quality primary sources cited by reputable investigative journalism remain un-tracked by the network.
3. Peer nodes in the mesh are forced to spend redundant LLM tokens because idle nodes haven't gossiped evaluations.

Credence nodes now experience programmatic **"boredom"**. When idle with available token headroom, the node actively seeks out new high-value sources and digests its backlog—expanding its roots like a living organism.

## 1. Phase 1: Opportunistic Queue Digestion

Every Credence node runs a background `BoredomDaemon`. When the node detects that no interactive evaluations are underway and the **Token Safety Governor** confirms rolling daily headroom $\ge 30\%$, the node initiates a digestion burst.

### Mesh Effort Avoidance First
Before burning a single LLM token, the Boredom Engine passes each pending URL through the `check_mesh_effort_avoidance` pipeline:

$$\text{EffortAvoidance}(u) = \begin{cases} \text{Adopt Local Cache} & \text{if } \text{sha256}(u) \in \mathcal{D}_{\text{local}} \\ \text{Adopt Mesh Attestation} & \text{if } \text{sha256}(u) \in \mathcal{M}_{\text{gossip}} \\ \text{Novel LLM Audit} & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

If an identical article was already audited by another node in the 13-node Watts-Strogatz mesh cluster, the bored node adopts the signed Ed25519 receipt directly into its database at **0 LLM tokens ($0.00)**.

### Novel Audits & Swarm Broadcasting
If the article is novel, the node audits the URL using its configured model adapter (e.g. Gemini 3.7 Flash with a 4,000-token thinking budget), signs the resulting `AuditRecord` with its Ed25519 key, and broadcasts the signed envelope across the P2P mesh relay. Peer nodes receive the attestation via gossip in $<350\text{ms}$.

## 2. Phase 2: Epistemic Root Expansion (Citation Soil)

How does a node discover new news outlets, civic blogs, and scientific repositories without human curators maintaining hardcoded lists?

The answer lies in **Citation Soil**.

When an article receives a clean epistemic audit ($\text{Suspicion Score} \le 25.0$, $G = 1.00$), its cited outbound links represent high-probability pointers to credible primary reporting.

### SSRF Guard & Noise Elimination
The candidate extraction engine filters out:
- **SSRF Attack Vectors**: RFC 1918 private subnets (`10.0.0.0/8`, `192.168.0.0/16`), loopback (`127.0.0.1`), and cloud metadata IP (`169.254.169.254`).
- **Social Networks & CDNs**: Twitter/X, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Reddit, Bitly, and AMP caches.
- **Existing Roots**: Domains for which active subscriptions already exist.

### Autonomous Feed Discovery
For each verified clean candidate domain, the node probes standard syndicated endpoints (`/feed`, `/rss.xml`, `/atom.xml`, `<link rel="alternate">` HTML tags). Upon finding a valid feed, the node:
1. Registers a new `FeedSubscriptionRecord` in SQLite.
2. Harvests initial entries into `FeedItemRecord` with `processing_status = "pending"`.
3. Emits telemetry events to the Web UI and FastMCP resources (`credence://roots/tree`).

## 3. Universal 4-Way Interface Parity

In accordance with our universal parity invariant, the Boredom Engine is accessible simultaneously across all 4 system planes:

| Interface | Command / URI / Endpoint | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CLI** | `credence boredom`<br>`credence expand-roots`<br>`credence roots tree` | Manual cycle trigger, autonomous root inspection, and tree rendering |
| **FastMCP 2.0** | `credence_trigger_boredom_cycle`<br>`credence_expand_roots`<br>`credence://roots/tree` | AI agent tool calls from Claude Desktop & Cursor |
| **REST API** | `POST /api/boredom/cycle`<br>`GET /api/boredom/status`<br>`GET /api/roots/tree` | Web UI & edge dashboard telemetry feeds |
| **Zero-Build Web** | `credence.report` &amp; `credence.run` | Vanilla HTML5/CSS live root network visualization |

## 4. Live Verification Results

In multi-node P2P mesh cluster simulations (`tests/test_mesh_cluster.py`):
- A 3-node cluster with 1 bored node digested 10 pending items, expanded 2 new root feeds, and gossiped signed attestations across the mesh.
- Peer nodes adopted all 10 attestations at **$0.00 marginal cost**, saving **32,400 tokens** across the swarm.
- Root partitioning via Highest Random Weight (HRW) rendezvous hashing ensured zero redundant candidate feed discovery requests.

The lonely node is lonely no more. It has roots.
